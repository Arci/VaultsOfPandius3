<h2>Section 1: The Basics</h2>

<b>What is Mystara?</b>

<blockquote>
Mystara is a campaign setting for the Dungeons and Dragons role-playing 
game, it is a high-fantasy, high-magic, expansive campaign setting.
</blockquote>

<b>What do I need to play?</b>

<blockquote>
The Mystara game world has existed for some time under a number of 
different rules systems - therefore this question is not easy to answer 
and is dependant upon which rules system you used; for third edition 
Dungeons and Dragons the three basic rulebooks

<p>the Players Handbook
<br>the Dungeon Master's Guide
<br>and the Monster Manual

</p><p>are all that is needed.  For basic campaign information there has
 been no single source officially collected.  This site is producing a 
guide which should remedy this situation for new players.
</p></blockquote>

<b>What is a role-playing game?</b>

<blockquote>
Role-playing games are games in which people play the role of 
imaginary fantastic characters like warriors or wizards and try to complete
an adventure under the guidance of a game master.
</blockquote>

<b>Under what rules is Mystara supported?</b>

<blockquote>
Mystara products have been produced under a number of different rules 
systems over the years and this carries through to the present day with 
material being produced for each system.  Therefore it is one goal of 
these pages to support all these systems even though 3rd edition 
Dungeons and Dragons is the current system.  Therefore the rules that 
Mystara is supported under include Dungeons and Dragons (known as 
D&amp;D or OD&amp;D), Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition (known 
as AD&amp;D or 2E) and Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition (known as 3E).  
Many people also play under their own house rules and their files if 
made publicly available are also placed on this website although these 
rules are not supported.
</blockquote>

<b>What is the current status of Mystara?</b>

<blockquote>
The game world of Mystara was dropped by TSR a number of years ago and 
of all the "dead" campaign worlds it seems to be the most dead with no 
word from Wizards on it at all.  Despite this, or perhaps because of it,
 there is a strong online community supporting Mystara in all it's 
forms.
</blockquote>

<a name="setting"></a>
<h2>Section 2: Setting</h2>

<b>What is the Known World?</b>

<blockquote>
The Mystara campaign setting evolved from an area called the Known 
World, this is the area of the setting where many of the initial 
products specifically took place and in which most of the subsequent 
products have been situated.
</blockquote>

<b>What is Red Steel / the Savage Coast?</b>

<blockquote>
The line of products known as 'Red Steel' were one of the last line of 
Mystara-based products made.  It takes part in a region known as the 
Savage Coast, this area is located to the west of the Known World.  The 
area is totally compatible with the rest of Mystara however the area is 
thematically distinct as noted in the following excerpt from the Savage 
Coast Campaign Book.

<p><i>The SAVAGE COAST campaign setting is unique in many ways. Though 
this fantasy setting has magic, heroes, and everything else one would 
expect, the new swashbuckling and panache rules add both individual 
flavour and style. The land also lends fantastic, magical powers to all 
types of player characters. Still, it is a savage frontier, suffering 
under a magical bane called the Red Curse.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<b>What is the Hollow World?</b>

<blockquote>
The Mystara game world is a hollow sphere, and the inside of the planet 
is inhabited.  It holds old civilisations that are now extinct on the 
surface, placed there by the Immortals to protect their cultures, there 
are strong magics in place preventing them from evolving much or dying 
away.  The only entrances to the Hollow World are through underground 
passages between the two worlds, and through the holes that stand in 
place of the north and south poles.
</blockquote>

<b>What is Blackmoor?</b>

<blockquote>
Blackmoor is an area that has some history in a number of TSR products, 
Mystara included.  Blackmoor was, like Greyhawk, the campaign world of 
one of TSR's
founder, Dave Arneson. It was later placed in both Greyhawk and the 
Known
World.  There is no further relation between the two Blackmoors of
Mystara and Greyhawk.
</blockquote>

<b>What is Voyage of the Princess Ark?</b>

<blockquote>
The <i>Voyage of the Princess Ark</i> was a storyline in Dragon magazine
 written by Bruce Heard.  It ran from issues 153 to 188 and it expanded 
upon the Heldannic Knights and the Savage Coast.  It introduced 
characters such as Herr Wulf von Klagendorf, Haldemar of Haaken and 
Synn.
</blockquote>

<b>What are immortals?</b>

<blockquote>
The Mystara game world is not looked over by other-worldly deities, 
there are however immortals.  Immortals are mortals who, through their 
deeds, have reached a higher status granting them more power than mere 
mortals.  These immortals have extraordinary powers and take it upon 
themselves to look over Mystara.  They also perform the functions of 
deities in other game worlds in that they are the source of clerical 
spells and powers.  Now whilst immortals were once mortal some do not 
remember their mortal beings although there is nothing to suggest that 
they weren't mortal.  It also should be noted that whilst a number of 
immortals share the same name as deities in other game worlds or real 
world deities that immortals are not deities, they are not all-powerful 
and have their own agendas and foibles like mortals.

<p>It is also possible for player characters to become immortal although
 this is a difficult task and could be the goal of a whole campaign, or 
series of campaigns, to allow one player to attain immortality.  An 
all-immortal campaign is also a possibility of course.
</p></blockquote>

<b>Where is Blackmoor located?</b>

<blockquote>
Bruce Heard's said: <i>Blackmoor -- the travelling legend. If there were
 archaeologists on Mystara, they would have a devil of time figuring 
where the darn place was really located. Officially, it's supposed to be
 up there by the Thonian Marches. Unfortunately, conflicting info has 
crept into several products, getting in the way of the Thonian theory. 
The best thing is to assume evidence of Blackmoor's presence elsewhere 
is the result of later colonisations and outposts. Other communities 
were also magically displaced (such as a certain ancient tavern in the 
Broken Lands of the Known World).  Definitely a messy development of the
 World of Mystara!  :) </i>
<p>It should be noted that on the map in the Hollow World boxed set that
 the names of Blackmoor and Thonia have been reversed (Blackmoor was 
north of the Empire of Thonia according to all other sources)
</p></blockquote>

<b>Who are the immortals of the Church of Karameikos?</b>

<blockquote>
These are the immortals of the Church of Karameikos, as given by Bruce Heard in an old Dragon Magazine:
<br>Asterius (Eternal of Thought), Leader  
<br>Kagyar (Eternal of Matter)
<br>Ilsundal (Hierarch of Thought)
<br>Valerias (Hierarch of Matter)
<br>Vanya (Empyreal of Time).
<br>Although Chardastes is a native Traladaran Immortal, he is venerated
 through the auspices of the Church of Karameikos, not the Church of 
Traladara.  This is extrapolated from info in B1-9 In Search of 
Adventure.
<br>The Immortals of the Church of Traladara are:
<br>Halav
<br>Petra
<br>Zirchev
</blockquote>

<b>Is Jaggar von Drachenfels the Star Dragon?</b>

<blockquote>
No. According to Bruce Heard's <a href="http://pandius.com/immguard.html">article</a> in Dragon #170 he became the Star Dragon for a brief period but relinquished the title for absolution.
</blockquote>

<b>What is the Wrath of the Immortals?</b>

<blockquote>
Wrath of the Immortals (or WotI) is an epic campaign that TSR published 
to update the Known World.  It deals with the Great War that involves 
the major countries of Mystara and that was caused by the Immortals to 
obtain control of the Nucleus of the Spheres, a powerful artifact 
located under Glantri.  At the end of the war, Alphatia sinks, Glantri 
and Thyatis have suffered dramatically from the conflict and three new 
powers enter the political scene of Mystara: the Heldannic Territories, 
the Hagiarchy of Hule and the "revamped" Kingdom of Karameikos.
</blockquote>

<b>What has happened to Rad after Wrath of the Immortals?</b>

<blockquote>
As a result of the events during WotI Rad was absorbed into the 
Radiance, and some of his life force was used to lessen the drain of the
 artifact on Mystara's magic: thus there is only a Day of Dread each 
year, and not a week as in Wrath. Rad is not dead though, but he has 
been put into a slumbering state to reflect on his deeds, and hopefully 
change.  This is covered in detail in the module Mark of Amber.  The 
outcome of the module vary from campaign to campaign, as the actions of 
the PCs in the module decide Rad's fate.  The module's three outcomes 
are: 1. He returns as a mortal with no chance of being sponsored back to
 Immortality and no access to the Radiance; 2. He returns as a mortal 
but can become an Immortal again sometime (considered to be the most 
likely outcome); 3. He returns as a full Immortal.  Later products avoid
 the issue, and the general consensus is that he should return but be 
left in the background, keeping a low profile for some time, either 
rebuilding his following (if an Immortal) or attempting to reach 
Immortality again (if mortal). Few favour him becoming a mere mortal 
with no chance of reattaining immortality.
</blockquote>

<b>What has happened to the Radiance after Wrath of the Immortals?</b>

<blockquote>
In WotI, the Radiance is altered to draw from the sphere of Entropy 
instead of the sphere of Energy.  Yet in GKoM, the rules for the 
Radiance are exactly the same as in Gaz3, stating that it drains from 
Energy.  This is a mistake in GKoM; the authors overlooked that event in
 Wrath and forgot to update the info from Gaz3.  Thus the new rules for 
the Radiance are undefined, as are the effects of Entropy-draining.  
Various suggestion have been made on the MML, though.
</blockquote>

<b>What happened to Specularum?</b>

<blockquote>
Specularum was the name of the capital of the Grand Ducky of Karameikos.
  During the events of Wrath of the Immortals, in AC 1006, Duke Stefan 
of Karameikos seceded from the Empire of Thyatis becoming King of the 
Kingdom of Karameikos.  On Nuwmont 1 AC 1012 Stefan renamed the capital 
Mirros.
</blockquote>

<b>Where is Teldon?</b>

<blockquote>
From Dragon Magazine #207 about Teldon's fate: <i>"One of the 
attractions of the Magicians' Guild, its location in Karameikos' largest
 city, was its downfall. Such a collection of powerful (and often 
egotistical or secretive) mages in one location created great potential 
for conflict. The final straw was the creation of a mechanical beholder 
by one of the more advanced apprentices, powered by an Immortal's 
artifact. The resulting creation was turned loose in downtown 
Specularum, levelling a good section of the South End. The creation was 
defeated by the head of the Magicians' Guild, Teldon, but at great cost.
 Both mage and monster disappeared in a pure white ball of fire, and 
while they are assumed to have both been destroyed, they may instead 
have been teleported to some far-off location. The fact remained that 
the Magicians' Guild proved itself too dangerous to remain in 
Specularum, and lost one of its most valuable  supporters."</i>
</blockquote>

<b>Where is Bargle?</b>

<blockquote>
After the fall of the Black Eagle Barony, Bargle is an itinerant villain
 that pops up here and there.  He can easily be used as a recurring 
villain who the PCs bump into.  He has been spotted in various place, 
including Esterhold and Serraine (always helping the evil guys, of 
course), but can have business anywhere.
</blockquote>

<b>Is Kol a shadowelf or a kobold?</b>

<blockquote>
Most sources present Kol as a kobold who, using the rules from Gaz10: 
Orcs of Thar, could cast spells.  In Glantri: Kingdom of Magic (one of 
the last printed Mystaran products), he is said to be one of the 
deformed shadowelf babies raised by the humanoids, thus explaining both 
his high intelligence and spellcasting abilities under the AD&amp;D 
rules.  It is both an interesting plot, and a disappointment to many, as
 it removes again from the humanoids any glint of chance that they can 
achieve something by themselves.  Many people ignore that section in 
GKoM referring to Kol as a shadowelf preferring to have more realistic 
humanoids whilst others prefer the potential of having Kol as a 
shadowelf.  As always use whatever version suits your campaign and your 
taste best.
</blockquote>

<b>What happened to the continental map published in the Master DM's book?</b>

<blockquote>
According to Bruce Heard in Dragon #153 the map in the Master set is 
"wrong, wrong, wrong!"  The map was supposedly released by a very 
imaginative Thyatian, and wrongly accepted for the truth.  There is no 
Empire of Dorphin IV, no Empire of the Great Khan, etc.  Also, as you 
probably guessed, the size of the Thyatian Empire was largely 
exaggerated on this map.

<p>However since then people have used names and countries from this 
list to create things in their campaign, and of course in your own 
campaign you are free to use anything you want in your campaign.
</p></blockquote>

<b>How do the Mystaran novels fit into things?</b>

<blockquote>
Some of the Mystaran novels, particularly from memory the Dragonlord 
Chronicles, do not fit well into other established pieces of Mystaran 
continuity.  Whilst for any given campaign you, the DM, is free to 
choose what you want to make up your campaign.  Generally speaking 
however, the general Mystaran net-community does not consider the novels
 to supersede any other published information.
</blockquote>

<b>How does the D&amp;D Movie fit with Alphatia?</b>

<blockquote>
Izmer, the setting of the D&amp;D movies was inspired by Alphatia.  Here is Dave Arneson on the land of <a href="http://pandius.com/izmer.html">Izmer</a>.

<h2>Section 3: Products</h2>

<b>Is there a complete list of Mystaran products?</b>

<blockquote>
David Keyser has compiled a <a href="http://pandius.com/prodlist.html">complete list of products</a>.  The list was compiled 06 October 2000.  Given the imminent release of new products David has a look over what has been <a href="http://pandius.com/rcntprod.html">published recently</a> that has relations back to Mystara.  The post was make 03 July 2003.
</blockquote>

<b>Have there been any Mystaran articles in Dragon / Dungeon magazine?</b>

<blockquote>
The product list, above, contains much of the information on Mystaran 
articles in Dragon and Dungeon magazine.  However, two supplementary 
files <a href="http://pandius.com/dragon.html">Dragon</a> and <a href="http://pandius.com/dungeon.html">Dungeon</a> exist which contain information on those issues with Mystara related information and the nature of that information.

<p>With the recent inclusion of a number of Mystara related articles in Dragon issue 315, a number of <a href="http://pandius.com/drag_315.html">reviews</a> have been written by <a href="http://pandius.com/authors.html#herve">Hervï¿½ Musseau</a>, from the Mystara Mailing List posted 21-3 December 2003 for the articles. 
</p></blockquote>

<b>What is the current status of the online release schedule of Mystaran products?</b>

<blockquote>
The online release schedule is presumably back on track although there 
has been no word given on when things will be released although 
everything, including Mystaran products will presumably be released in 
the near future.

<b>How do I join the Mystara Mailing List?</b>

<b>How do I access the Mystara Message Boards?</b>

<blockquote>
The Mystara Message Boards are accessible through an Internet browser through the <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/forumdisplay.php?f=291">Wizards</a> site.
</blockquote>

<b>How do I access old messages from the Mystara Message Boards or from old versions of the Mystara Message Boards)?</b>

<blockquote>
With the current version of the Mystara Message Boards it should be 
possible to always access the older messages.  This was claimed to be 
true for the old versions of the Mystara Message Boards but was never 
borne out, therefore messages from previous versions of the Mystara 
Message Boards have been lost.  Articles of note have been retained here
 on the Vaults of Pandius but discussion, as it does, often ranged 
further than the articles of note that were produced.
</blockquote>

<b>Are there Mystaran chat groups?</b>

<blockquote>
There are a number of Mystaran chat groups:

<blockquote><a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/travelersofmystara/">Travellers of Mystara</a>;
 
<br>and <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/alphatiamystara/">Alphatia Mystara</a>.

<b>What are all these acronyms that are being used?</b>

<b>Can I download the "Mystaran" font?</b>

There was a true type font used in the Gazetteer range of products that 
some people have taken on board as being the "Mystaran" font.  The name 
of the font was later revealed as Feinen Bold.  This font does not 
appear to be freely available and has been exhibited for sale from a

<h2>Section 5: Third Edition and the Future of Mystara</h2>

<b>Is there a conversion of Dungeons and Dragons / Mystara into 3rd Edition?</b>

<blockquote>
There has already been a lot of activity in bringing the Mystara game world into 3E with most activity going on at the <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/mystara3E/">Mystara 3E Discussion Group</a>, with the fruits of this project intended to be compiled at <a href="http://mystaranet.jamm.com/m3e">Mystara 3E Conversion Project</a> pages at some stage.  Fan 3E sites unrelated to this project also exist with the most notable being <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/6011/">The Lighthouse</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/isledawn/">Twilight of the Dawn</a>.
</blockquote>

<b>What is the purpose of this site?</b>

<blockquote>
When it was created the purpose of the site was to collect articles of 
interest created on the Mystara Mailing List, it was then expanded to 
collect articles of interest from the Mystara Message Boards.  Because 
of these activities for the mailing list the site was chosen to be the 
official repository for such articles for the mailing list, the site was
 later chosen by Wizards of the Coast to be the official website for 
Mystara.  This latest decision has allowed the site to canonise material
 which has not yet happened, the site is therefore still primarily a 
location of articles of interest created by fans of the Mystara game 
world.
</blockquote>

<b>Why is it called the Vaults of Pandius?</b>

<blockquote>
Pandius is a city it is the neutral meeting place of immortals on 
Patera, Mystara's invisible moon.  Although no vaults of information 
have been described for the city it is not unreasonable that such a 
system might exist in Pandius.  If it does then this site is it.
</blockquote>

<b>Are the articles on this site official?</b>

<blockquote>
Apart from the html representations of articles created by TSR (like the
 Savage Coast Monstrous Compendium, Alien Devices from Blackmoor, etc) 
no.  Whilst it is within the power of this site to canonise new material
 that has not yet been done for various reasons. 
</blockquote>

<b>Are the articles on this site internally consistent?</b>

<blockquote>
No, each articles in the Vaults is not consistent with each other 
article in the Vaults; most are created by separate authors from their 
own campaigns.  That being said however most articles are not 
inconsistent with other articles, in other words most articles that 
weren't created in the same frame of mind can exist in the same 
consistent game world.  In general, however articles created by the same
 author tend to be consistent with other works created by that author, 
also the almanacs are consistent with each other and many non-almanac 
works by almanac team members tend to be consistent with the almanac.
</blockquote>

<b>Who looks after the Vaults of Pandius?</b>

<blockquote>
I wasn't looking for any sort of sympathy with this question but instead
 to combat a misconception that there are a team of us who look after 
the Vaults.  There isn't, there's only me.
